/*
Write a program to input a number and check if it is a Disarium Number.
A number is called Disarium if sum of its digits powered with their respective positions is equal to the number itself.
Example:-
135 is a Disarium number because,
135 â‡’ 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 135. So, 135 is a Disarium number.
